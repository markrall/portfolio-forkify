// replace `food2fork` with `forkify-api`

// ðŸ‘‰ Here are the 3 things that you need to know about forkify-api which are DIFFERENT from the food2fork API in the videos:

// 1) No API key is required;
// 2) No proxy is required;
// 3) The URL is forkify-api.herokuapp.com (click for basic documentation)

// ðŸ‘‰ This is how you use forkify-api instead of the food2fork API.

// In the Search.js file (as soon as you get there), just replace:

//     const res = await axios(`${PROXY}http://food2fork.com/api/search?key=${KEY}&q=${this.query}`);

// with this:

//     const res = await axios(`https://forkify-api.herokuapp.com/api/search?&q=${this.query}`);


// Then, in Recipe.js (as soon as you get there), please replace:

//     const res = await axios(`${PROXY}http://food2fork.com/api/get?key=${KEY}&rId=${this.id}`);

// with this:

//     const res = await axios(`https://forkify-api.herokuapp.com/api/get?rId=${this.id}`);


// ðŸ‘‰ That's it, that's all you need to know. Again, make these changes as you go through the projects. For now, just keep following the videos. And now, have fun with the project ðŸ˜˜
